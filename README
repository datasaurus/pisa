The pisa application creates a Cartesian plot in an SVG document.
Elements defined with Cartesian coordinates are read from standard
input and placed in the plot. Pisa makes the necessary transformations
from Caresian to document coordinates. It also draws suitable axes and
labels. An optional Javascript file adds interactivity, for panning
and zooming in web browsers. Without interactivity, the program creates
standard, static SVG files, which can be edited with Inkscape or converted
to other formats with ImageMagick, rsvg-convert, or similar.  For more
information see pisa (1) man page.
