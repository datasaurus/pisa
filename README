The pisa application creates a Cartesian plot in an SVG document.
Elements defined with Cartesian coordinates are read from standard
input and placed in the plot, with axes and labels. An optional
Javascript file adds interactivity. Otherwise, the program creates
standard, static SVG files, which can be edited with Inkscape or
converted to other formats with ImageMagick or rsvg-convert. For more
information see pisa (1) man page.
